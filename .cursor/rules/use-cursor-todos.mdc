When working on tasks or identifying work to be carried out, actively use Cursor's TODO feature to track and organize your development work. This practice delivers:

1. Task Organization: Create TODO comments to mark specific areas requiring attention
2. Progress Tracking: Use TODO comments to track completed work versus remaining tasks
3. Code Navigation: Cursor highlights and enables navigation between TODO comments
4. Team Collaboration: Other developers can easily see planned work and progress

Examples:
- // TODO: Implement error handling for this function
- # TODO: Add unit tests for this class
- /* TODO: Refactor this method to use the new API */

Best Practices:
- Write specific, actionable TODO descriptions
- Include context explaining why the TODO exists
- Maintain consistent TODO comment formatting
- Remove TODO comments upon completion
- Add priority levels when appropriate (e.g., TODO(HIGH): Fix critical bug)

This practice enhances code maintainability and ensures all work items receive proper attention during development.
